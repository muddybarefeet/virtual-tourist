#Virtual Tourist

This app allows you to travel 'virtually' to any place in the world. The idea is that by selecting a location on the map, the user can view an album of photos for this location.

This app is built using the Flickr API to provide images from given cooridinates, which are then stored in core data objects and persisited to the database.
